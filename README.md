Buzzy Fly
========

Old Java project for Washtenaw Community College's Advanced Java Concepts class. We were asked to make a networked game, with no other details or restrictions other than that we use the gameNet library provided by the instructor.

If you haven't guessed, this game's basically a clone of Flappy Bird, except it's a fly that buzzes. The game also works somewhat differently, in that it's not as brutally difficult as Flappy Bird, and you gain speed as you clear pillars. (And it's multiplayer, of course)

It's also kind of slow, because it uses Swing for rendering and probably sends too many packets. I did get an A in the class, however.
